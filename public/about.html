<h1>ABOUT HACI CAKIN</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm HACI CAKIN, the owner of Moon Company. I was born on December 17, 2003. Growing up in difficult circumstances during my infancy, maybe that was the reason I made
   it to where I am today. In my childhood, I stayed in orphanages and learned what life was like. I developed myself there and gained my perspective on the world. In my high 
   school years, 
      
  .</p>

<p> I had to work. I worked as a waiter in hotels and in various industries. I realized that making money on my own was a good thing. Then, an opportunity came my way
  - e-commerce. Buying and selling products appealed to me, and it was quite convenient. I attended Okan University for my studies. My dream was to become a pilot,
   but unfortunately, I couldn't achieve that. I did, however, achieve my second goal of becoming a software engineer. I decided to focus on self-improvement in this field.</p>

<p>In the first year, I didn't accomplish much, but later, driven by my enthusiasm and concern for the future, I decided to start doing something. 
  I began generating many projects and could feel my own growth. That's how my life has been.</p>
  <p>

    May my experiences be an inspiration to you, and may millions of people create beautiful memories.

    **Thank you everyone**
